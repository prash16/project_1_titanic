# results

This directory should include files generated during cleanup and analysis. This could include:

- intermediate results
- cleaned data sets
- simulated data sets
- final results (such as figures and tables)

Given the heterogeneity of things that can be classified as results, the results directory will usually require additional subdirectories.
