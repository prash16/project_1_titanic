# src

This directory should include project source code. This is all code written for the project, from both interpreted (e.g., R or Python) and compiled (e.g., Fortran, C++, or Java) languages, as well as shell scripts, snippets of SQL used to pull information from databases, and other code used in the project.

Example of file types that belong in src:

- .R
- .py
- .Rmd
